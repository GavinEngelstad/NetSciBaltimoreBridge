    - `avg_spath.ipynb`: Print the data presented on the average shortest path
    - `node_stats.ipynb`: Figures for the centrality measures
    - `spaths.ipynb`: Figures in the average shortest paths sections *Note: This won't work with the provided data files. The file it used is 20gb in size, so I didn't upload it to github. If you want it, email me (soon, otherwise I'm going to delete it)*
- `utilization_results`: Make the figures in the utilization part of the results section
    - `centralities.ipynb`: Make the figures for the weighted centralities
