 Gavin's Spring 2024 Network Science Project

The `paper` and `presentation` folders include graphs, maps, pictures, .tex files, and pdfs used to create the final products. 

The `data` folder includes the data used in our analysis. Within it, there are four folders. The `network` folder within it store the network pulled from OSMnx. The `network_stats` folder stores calculated statistics for the network. The `utilization` folder stores data on use and census tract and state data used to make maps. The `utilization_stats` folder includes calculated values used to analyze the use-weighted versions of our network.

The `code` folder includes the code used in our analysis. Within it, there are three folders. The `centrality_analysis` folder includes the code to get/store the network and analyze it. The `utilization_analysis` folder includes the code to create the use-weighted statistics. The `figures` folder includes the python notebooks used to make the figures you see in the paper. Each of these folders includes their own README that farther explains the files within them.
